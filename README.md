# Detecting Cyber Attacks in IoT Networks

This repository contains my coursework for the Data Analytics module at the University of Roehampton. The project focuses on identifying and classifying IoT cybersecurity vulnerabilities using machine learning.

## Title
**Detecting Cyber Attacks in IoT Networks: A Machine Learning Analysis on the Edge-IIoTset Dataset**

## Author
**Sonika Ravi**  
Student ID: A00046396  
Instructor: Yusuf Izmirlioglu

## Contents
- `DataAnalitics.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook (exploratory data analysis + ML models)
- `SonikaRavi-A00046396.pdf` – Final report (30+ pages)

## Machine Learning Models Used
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- XGBoost

## Results
- **XGBoost** achieved **93.6% accuracy**
- Most important features: severity score, attack vector, patch availability

## Dataset
500 real-world IoT vulnerabilities, collected from public CVE databases and reports.

## Key Highlights
- Feature engineering for device types, vulnerability age, and severity bins
- EDA on attack vectors and device categories
- Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

## Report
The full research report is included in this repo:
